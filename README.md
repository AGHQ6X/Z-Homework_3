# Z-Homework_3

### Branch Contributors:

* Alexis Harper

### Project Explaination:

The project is able to import CSV files from disk (default directory being the project directory) and store the info for it as modifyable objects with add and remove functionality. It is then able to update the CSV file to contain the modified list.

### Project Dependencies:

The only dependencies for this project are the default Java JRE System Library jars.

### Running the Program:

Because the Main function does not do anything useful on it's own, the Eclipse project enclosed may be opened and the Main can be edited to test code (default is testing the most recent method to be committed). The packages may also be imported into another project to be used as a library.
